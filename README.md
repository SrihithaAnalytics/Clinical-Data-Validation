# Clinical-Data-Validation  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **clinical data cleaning, validation, and dashboarding** using a **dummy clinical trial dataset** (de-identified).  
It simulates real-world tasks in data management and analytics, including:  
- Data validation and discrepancy checks  
- Query resolution log  
- Trend analysis and reporting  
- Dashboards for data integrity monitoring

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Excel** → Data cleaning, validation, and dashboards  
- **SQL (basic)** → Sample queries for validation & extraction  
- **Power BI (optional)** → Interactive visual dashboards  

---

## 📊 Project Files  
- `Dummy_Clinical_Trial_Data.xlsx` → Sample dataset  
- `SQL_Data_Validation.sql` → Example SQL queries for validation  
- `Dashboard_Screenshots/` → Screenshots of dashboards

## 📈 Example Use Cases  
1. **Data Validation** – Check for missing values, duplicates, invalid dates  
2. **Query Resolution** – Track discrepancies and resolution rates  
3. **Trend Analysis** – Identify enrollment trends and query closure performance  
4. **Dashboards** – Share insights with stakeholders  

---

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Download `Dummy_Clinical_Trial_Data.xlsx`  
2. Run the data validation steps (tabs inside Excel)  
3. Use `SQL_Data_Validation.sql` for additional data checks  
4. View dashboards in Excel or Power BI
